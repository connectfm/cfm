					/*
					RESPONSE TO ABOVE (rdt17):
						I think that is too much responsibility for a single class; too much coupling. Let
						this class just be responsible for giving you a song URI. Keeping the whole thing as
						a pipeline of transformations will help keep the logic organized. Using the Java
						functional API / lambda notation:
							1. Get recommended song URI: () -> recommender.recommend()
							2. Get song metadata (album image, artist, etc.): r -> getMetadata(r)
							3. Add song to the playback queue: s -> queue.add(s)
						I'm not sure if this actually how it is organized, but entangling the functionality
						like that will make debugging a nightmare. To go along with the SongService naming
						convention, the RecommendService, SongService, and PlaybackService should be
						completely oblivious to each other. They all do (or at least should do) different,
						independent tasks.

					/*
					RESPONSE TO ABOVE (rdt17):
						There is nothing the server needs to know. All it does is gives recommendations. All
						data it receives is from ElastiCache, which is after its been saved in DataStore,
						synced to DynamoDB, and then processed by Alexs' Lambda function to be put into the
						cache.
