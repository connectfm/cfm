# connect.fm

connect.fm is a context-aware music recommendation and streaming mobile Android application. The recommender system uses clustering and personalized sampling of songs based on a users' location, preference for discovering new music, and the tastes of nearby users to provide a dynamic listening experience. See [this paper](https://github.com/connectfm/cfm/blob/main/technical-docs.pdf) (pp. 1—20) for the project documentation and the theory behind the recommender system (pp. 21—38).
